# 2048-Board-Game
2048 is a logic game played usually on 4x4 board. The board contains blocks of various values. In each turn, the player choses the direction (up, down, left, right) in which all blocks on the board will move. During the turn, a collision of two blocks can happen. If they are of same value, they will be merged together to form single block of doubled value. After the turn, a random spot on the board is chosen and a new block with value of 2 (rarely 4) will spawn on that spot. At the beginning, there are two blocks of values 2 (rarely 4). The player is winner if he manages to combine blocks into a block with value of 2048. If there is no direction, in which there would be a movement of at least one block, then the player is declared as a loser.
